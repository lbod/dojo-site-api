dojo-site-data
==============

This repository stores all the json data needed for the Dojo API viewer to run over node.js i.e. http://github.com/lbod/dapi

This also stores the legacy HTML files for Dojo toolkit versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 & 1.7. 
These are stored as HTML files because they have been generated using the deprecated PHP viewer tooling, dapi will load these legacy HTML files rather than create the API from a datasource.

Note that the tree.json files are still required for legact API's i.e in the ./data/1.3 etc folders
